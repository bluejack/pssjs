# pssjs

A typescript client for the pixesl starships game api.

Inspired by:

- https://github.com/t1f7/pythonstarships
- https://github.com/PSS-Tools-Development/pssapi.py

Note, requires an environment variable 'PSS_SALT' to contain the not-so-secret
savy-soda string to secure the hash which seeds the checksum which allows
an auth token.
